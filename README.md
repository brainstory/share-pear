Share Pear is a platform built with Astro, Netlify On-Demand Builders, and Edge
Functions to consume markdown content and generate public HTML pages from that
content!

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/b15d7292-3501-4174-9510-d09e1dcae966/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/share-pear/deploys)

### 🏃‍♂️ How to run the repo locally

1. Clone the repo
2. Run `npm install && npm run dev`
3. Navigate to `localhost:3000/blog/whatever`

You'll have to hard-code in some URI-encoded markdown in the url, for example
`localhost:3000/blog/whatever/{MARKDOWN}`, to see how a blog looks.

### 🪄 How to use the site in general

1. Query `https://share.contenda.co/blog/[SOMETHING]` with a GET request
2. The headers of the GET request have to include `markdown: "blah"` where
   `blah` is the blog content. This request publishes your blog post at the
   `https://share.contenda.co/blog/[SOMETHING]` url for 30 days.
